# user-auth-api
This project is a basic user registration and authentication API built using FastAPI. It allows users to register, log in, and perform profile management operations such as viewing and updating their profiles. The authentication system is based on JWT (JSON Web Tokens), ensuring that users can securely access their data after logging in.
